# meansofproduction
A free as in beer application to manage a distributed library, especially a library of things

## Why
- Because there's no need for every person to buy every tool

- Because most library software isn't free, or assumes that the library owns the items

- Because control of the means of production is the material basis for everything

## Parts
- meansofproduction - domain objects that define the business logic and storage functions
- graphql_server - GraphQL API to support the front end
- web_client - browser based way to lend and borrow
- phone_client - ReactNative client for interacting
